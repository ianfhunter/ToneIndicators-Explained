# ToneIndicators Explained

## What is it?
A chrome extension that allows you to quickly explain Tone Indicators without leaving your webpage.

Double-Click to explain!

## How do I get it?

Right now, it's not on the Chrome store, we're working on that.

If you want - you can install it from a [.crx file in the latest release ](https://github.com/ianfhunter/ToneIndicators-Explained/releases)

Or from the unpackaged files directly [Here's a guide](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)
